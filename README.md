Quick Notes is a simple and convenient Chrome extension that allows you to create, save, and manage multiple notes directly within your browser. The extension features a user-friendly interface that resembles post-it notes, making it easy to jot down quick thoughts, reminders, or tasks.

Features:

Multiple Notes: Organize your notes by creating multiple entries, each accessible from a dedicated menu.

Persistent Storage: Your notes are saved securely using google sync, meaning they are synced across devices logged into the same Google account.

Storage Meter: Keep track of how much of the 100KB storage limit you've used with a handy meter displayed within the extension.
